[![build status](https://badgen.net/github/status/Shadowsocks-NET/Aurum?icon=github&label=Github+Actions&cache=300)](https://github.com/Shadowsocks-NET/Aurum/actions/workflows/build.yml)

Aurum is a cross-platform GUI for the v2ray family of anti-censorship applications.

`Aurum.*` is the backend library for command operations such as configuration generation and evaluation, v2ray instance
management and perhaps tun2socks support.

The graphical frontend project `Aurum.Micro` is hosted on a separate
repository [here](https://github.com/Shadowsocks-NET/Aurum.Micro).

Both of the backend and frontend is under active development and is not tested at all, please be careful.

## Usage

Aurum is still in active development. To use the development version of this library, please use
