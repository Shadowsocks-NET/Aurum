# Aurum
![build status](https://badgen.net/github/status/Shadowsocks-NET/Aurum?icon=github&label=Github+Actions&cache=300)

Aurum is a cross-platform GUI for the v2ray family of anti-censorship applications.

`Aurum.Micro` is the experimental, minimal GUI of this project, written in F# and Avalonia.FuncUI

`Aurum` is the backend library for command operations such as configuration generation and evaluation, v2ray instance management and perhaps tun2socks support.

_(planned)_ `Aurum.C_API` is a C-style API interface for the `Aurum` core library, which will allow languages that support calling a C-style API (FFI) to utilize the functionality provided by the `Aurum` core library.

For more information of each subprojects, reference to their individual README files.
